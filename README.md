PUT - Set all new attributes for an existing resource.\
PATCH - Partially update an existing resource (not all attributes required).
```
PUT /users/1
{
  "username": "skwee357",
  "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"  // new email address
}
PATCH /users/1
{
  "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"  // new email address
}
```
HTTP status ranges in a nutshell:
1xx: hold on
2xx: here you go
3xx: go away
4xx: you messed up
5xx: I messed up

Never trust user input. Assume that every route will be broken in some way.

Most common log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL - production; DEBUG, TRACE - development):
- FATAL: Used to represent a catastrophic situation â€” your application cannot recover. Logging at this level usually signifies the end of the program.
- ERROR: Represents an error condition in the system that happens to halt a specific operation, but not the overall system. You can log at this level when a third-party API is returning errors.
- WARN: Indicates runtime conditions that are undesirable or unusual, but not necessarily errors. An example could be using a backup data source when the primary source is unavailable.
- INFO: Info messages are purely informative. Events that are user-driven or application-specific may be logged at this level. A common use of this level is to log interesting runtime events, such as the startup or shutdown of a service.
- DEBUG: Used to represent diagnostic information that may be needed for troubleshooting.
- TRACE: Captures every possible detail about an application's behavior during development.

Should the endpoint name be singular or plural? The keep-it-simple rule applies here. Although your inner-grammatician will tell you it's wrong to describe a single instance of a resource using a plural, the pragmatic answer is to keep the URL format consistent and always use a plural. Not having to deal with odd pluralization (person/people, goose/geese) makes the life of the API consumer better and is easier for the API provider to implement (as most modern frameworks will natively handle /tickets and /tickets/12 under a common controller).
